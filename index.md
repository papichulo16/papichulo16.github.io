<p>I am a part time Vulnerability Researcher while studying Computer Science at Florida Institute of Technology, estimated to graduate in Fall 2027.</p>

<p>I really like low-level and bare-metal programming and computing. I started off with binary exploitation on CTF competitions and now I do other cool projects while also working. Here are some of the things I do:</p>

<ul>
 <li> PWN (binex) and RE (rev eng)</li>
 <li> Embedded and Baseband VR</li>
 <li> VR on Low Level Network Stacks</li>
 <li> Emulation</li>
 <li> OS dev</li>
 <li> Other cool things </li>
</ul>
